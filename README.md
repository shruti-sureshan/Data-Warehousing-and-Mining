# Data-Warehousing-and-Mining

A data warehouse is a technique for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insight. Data mining is looking for hidden, valid, and potentially useful patterns in huge data sets. This is the Repository where I have implemented the basic algorithms of Data Warehousing and Mining like:
•	K means Clustering<br/>
•	Linear regression<br/>
•	Naïve bayes<br/>
•	Page rank algorithm<br/>

Technologies used: JAVA 8, Eclipse IDE, Python, Jupyter Notebook
